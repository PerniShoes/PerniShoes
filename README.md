I studied at DAE (Digital Arts and Entertainment) for a year. Was enlisted for a Game Development course taught in C++.     
My love for C++ comes from the control it gives to it's user and it's high-performance. I really like how much there is to learn in C++.    
I love learning as much as possible about C++ and it's uses.    
Feel free to check out my repositories and progress I am making :D!
