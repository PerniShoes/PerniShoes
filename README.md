### Hello!
I am a 24 years old, ambitious and always smiling C++ programmer.
Looking for work/internship to improve my C++ knowledge and abilities :D. 
#

### How I met C++:
I studied at Digital Arts and Entertainment three years ago, enlisted for a Game Development course taught with C++.     
I sadly failed to get to second year, but learnt a lot. Both about C++ best practices and about myself. Had a rough year due to mental health and didn't do anything with C++.
I worked A LOT on myself, my habits, my mental health and got to a very good point in my life.
Around 2 months ago (22.04.2025) I decided to go back to learning C++ and to find a life-long career with it.

### Why? C++:
My love for it comes from the control it gives to it's user and it's high-performance. I really like how much there is to learn in C++.    
I love learning as much as possible about it and it's uses. There is never a "*enough* knowledge" with this beast.
