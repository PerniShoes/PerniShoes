### Hi there 👋

I'm Marek, from Poland. I studied at DAE (Digital Arts and Entertainment) for a year. I enlisted for a Game Development course taught in C++. Other than that I am self-taught. 
I love C++ for the control it gives to it's user and the it's high-performance. Feel free to check out my repositories and progress I am making :D
